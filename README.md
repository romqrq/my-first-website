# My very first webpage

Welcome!

This project is a basic website with three pages interlinked by the buttons on the navigation bar at the top of the screen.

Each of the pages contain images and links to different websites used as development tools.

As we add the images, they are aligned side by side from the left to the right until they reach the right side of the screen (in this case I limited it to 4 images per line), then they skip to the next line and so on. 
The problem with this method is that if one image is bigger than the others, it would be reflected on the way the arrangement takes place.
To solve this problem, I estabilished a standard size for the images so they will always be the same size.

Under each image there are hyperlinks that (as well as the images) will redirect the user to the website represented by the logo/name they clicked on.

The next step to be added to the code is to make the pages to open on a new tab so the user will still have my website open while visiting the second one.

The code for this project was based on the tutoring videos and text from Code Institute's Fullstack Development course.

Any suggestions, please don't hesitate in contacting me (by link for email) or (link for social media) or even adding to my code on (link to code on GitHub)

Thank you!
